<b>VR is back!</b>

And it's full of evil cubes.
Good news: you got a pair of morning stars to destroy them, it's quite satisfying.
Bad news: they will keep coming. FOREVER.

Game is based on a simpler Beat Saber mechanic where you destroy random cubes as they approach.

Tested on Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest, best at room scale with touch controllers.

I didn't know uglify would rewrite vars and so (I'm not expert at JS), so it contains short and reused variable names. Sorry!
